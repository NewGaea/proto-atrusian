The Proto-Atrusian verb complex is rich, with a number of tenses, aspects, and moods.

## Verb Classes

Verbs in Proto-Atrusian are split into two classes, _true verbs_ and _functional verbs_.

### True Verbs

True verbs are considered to be words that are fundamental actions and which mutate their stem vowels during the process of conjugation. Most _true verbs_ have a word-final closed syllable, whether they are one syllable or longer.

**Example:** _mat (to eat)_ is a true verb, which can be easily identified because it is a closed, single-syllable verb. The present tense of _mat_ is _m√°ta_, with a long vowel and /a/ suffix.

### Functional Verbs

Functional verbs are considered to be verbs that are derived from another word or part of speech, and typically end in a suffix with a word-final open syllable. Functional verbs are usually two or more syllables.
