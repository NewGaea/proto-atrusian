Nouns in Proto-Atrusian inflect for nominative and accusative case, and singular (which is 0-marked) or plural.

## Noun Classes

Nouns can be divided into three classes in Proto-Atrusian.

### Class I

Class I nouns are those which end in a single consonant, such as _taal_ or _atan_. All nouns which end in a single consonant belong to Class I. The nominative and singular forms for Class I nouns are 0-marked.

**Examples:** _kil_, _seler_, and _toron_ are all Class I nouns. They do not experience any mutations or inflections as nominative, singular nouns.

### Class II

Class II nouns are those which end in any single vowel except /e/. All nouns which end in any single vowel belong to Class II. The nominative forms for Class II devoice the final vowel, and the singular form is 0-marked.

**Examples:** _nana_, _kallo_, and _arda_ are all Class II nouns. Their final vowels are devoiced in the nominative, singular case, resulting in _nan_, _kall_, and _ard_ as the nominative singular forms.

### Class III

Class III nouns are those which end in /e/ or any clustered sound -- a consonant cluster or a diphthong. The nominative singular case of Class III nouns is formed by adding the nasal /m/, /n/, or /ng/, nearest to the place of articulation of the final consonant. If necessary, this nasal is appended as a syllabic nasal.

**Examples:** _huo_, _are_, and _lempe_ are all Class III nouns. They add a nasal to the ends, becoming _huong_, _aren_, and _lempem_ in their nominative singular forms.

### Accusative Case

In the accusative case, the final consonant sound is strengthened (if possible), and if the word does not end in a vowel /-o/ is added to the end of the word. From the examples above:

| Base Word   | Nom. Sing. | Acc. Sing. |
|:------------|:-----------|:-----------|
| kil         | kil        | kito       |
| seler       | seler      | seledo     |
| toron       | toron      | torono     |
| nana        | nan        | nana       |
| kallo       | kall       | kalto      |
| arda        | ard        | arda       |
| huo         | huong      | kuo        |
| are         | aren       | ade        |
| lempe       | lempem     | lembe      |

Normally, the strengthening process will result in voiceless consonants beoming their voiced counterpart, however /r/ becomes /d/, /l/ becomes /t/, and /h/ becomes /k/. Likewise, voiced fricatives will move up to a stronger manner of articulation -- /v/ becomes /b/, /dh/ and /z/ both become /d/, etc.

### Plural Number

Pluralisation in Proto-Atrusian distinguishes multiple count nouns, and each of the three classes follow their own rules.

#### Class I Plural

Class I plurals are formed by suffixing /i/ to the stem in nominative, or /en/ in accusative.

#### Class II Plural

Class II plurals are formed by suffixing /r/ to the stem in nominative or /ro/ in accusative.

#### Class III Plural

Class III plurals are formed by devoicing the final vowels or consonants and prefixing /ne/ in the nominative or /er/ in the accusative.

## Articles

Proto-Atrusian has three articles -- the definite and indefinite are likely familiar to most English speakers, but the third article is a conjunct article, meaning that it refers to a sequence of things as one.

Articles do not inflect for number, only case.

### Definite

The definite article is the word /il/ (nominative) or /ilo/ (accusative) and precedes a noun. It is technically optional, but commonly used to clarify known referents from unknown.

**Example:** "il kil" would translate as "the person" in a subject role, while "ilo kito" would translate as "the person" in an object role.

### Indefinite

The indefinite article is the word /e/ and is optional unless the word would be isolated otherwise. The indefinite article does not inflect for case.

**Example:** "e seler" would translate as "a sister." While the indefinite does not inflect, it is typically omitted in the nominative case.

### Conjunct

The conjunct article is /er/ in the nominative and /der/ in the accusative. The conjunct article is mandatory when any sequence of nouns is used, as in "brother and sister." This does not nullify the use of conjunctions, it only indicates that the following sequence serves as a compound.

**Example:** /er toron a seler/ would translate to "brother and sister" in a subject role, while /der torono a seledo/ would translate to "brother and sister" in an object role.

### Article Table

```
Article     | Nominative || Accusative |
========================================
DEFINITE    | il         || ilo        |
INDEFINITE  | e                        |
CONJUNCT    | er         || der        |
```

## Alternative Cases

While the primary cases in Proto-Atrusian are the nominative and accusative, there are other cases which pattern as nominative or accusative, but have their own suffixes.

### Dative (Accusative)

Within Proto-Atrusian, the Dative is used to refer to direct objects, and contrasts with the accusative which may be used for direct or indirect objects. It patterns as an accusative, and is used _only_ when there is more than one (non-conjunct) accusative.

Datives take on the nasal nearest to the word coda, in class II they also take the stop nearest to that nasal.

| DATIVES  | Class I  | Class II  | Class III |
|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Singular | -\[N\]a  | -\[NS\]o  | -a\[N\]u  |
| Plural   | -i\[N\]a | -re\[NS\] | -axum     |

### Genitive N (Nominative)

The first Genitive is used as the subject of a genitive relationship, in general this means the possessor, owner, or origin of something in a genitive relationship. When paired with a standard nominative noun, the _genitive n_ indicates an indirect subject referenced by relation to its reference.

The _Genitive N_ replaces the normal marking of a nominative singular, if it has marking, with a suffix of **-(o)no**, and maintains the number marking. Plurals for class I and II retain their plural marking, and only add **-on** as a suffix. Class III plurals, preserve the prefix _ne-_, but still remove the final coda of the word.

| GENITIVE N  | Class I | Class II | Class III |
|:--------:|:----------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| Singular | -ono       | -no      | -ono      |
| Plural   | -ion       | -ron     | ne-\*-ono |
