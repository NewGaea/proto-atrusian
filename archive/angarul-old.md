Angarul is a language evolved from the ancient tongue of [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya), first seen by men of this Age in JRR Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Though he never truly released his knowledge the language for use by others, Tolkien clearly knew, or had a solid understanding of, much of the Quenya and [Sindarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin) languages.

Unfortunately, this means that the full consistency of any language that expands on these tongues is limited, even assuming all the extrapolations of the language thus far to be accurate. A sample sentence in Angarul follows.

```ngloss
\ex Kenyufalre i lanper Angarul
\gl keny-ufal-re [speak-FUT-2.PL] [you will speak]
	i [DEF] [the]
	lanpe-r [tongue-PL] [tongues]
	angarul [Angarul] [Angarul]
\ft You will speak the tongues of Angarul.
```

This language developed among the Elves of a different world, and has changed little in over 5000 years. However the similarities to what is known, or presumed, of Quenya are visible, if not always obvious.

And so it can be seen that much of Angarul might be understandable quickly, if not immediately, to someone familiar with Quenya Elvish. The first place to go is looking at what's known of Quenya, and how Angarul varies from it.
## Verb Forms

Much like Quenya, the Verb Forms of Angarul have simple root forms and conjugations, into five basic tenses: Present, Past, Future, Imperative, and Subjunctive.

Using the Roots of "n" (to be) and "sir" (to shine), these 5 forms can be easily shown, as almost all Angarul verbs are regular in their conjugation.
### Singular Verb Tenses
|  | Present | Past | Future | Imperative | Subjunctive |
| ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| ***n-***<br>"to be" | *na*<br>"is" | *ne*<br>"was" | *nufa*<br>"will be" | *nei*<br>"be!" | *nai*<br>"may it be" |
| ***sir-***<br>"to shine" | *sira*<br>"shine" | *sire*<br>"shone" | *sirufa*<br>"will shine" | *sirei*<br>"shine!" | *sirai*<br>"may it shine" |

The plural of each tense above can be created by adding an "l" to the end. When the subject of a sentence in plural, the verb must also be plural, in Angarul. Quenya shows this in the term "_lassë lantar_" or "falling leaves."
### Plural Verb Tenses
|  | Present | Past | Future | Imperative | Subjunctive |
| ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| ***n-***<br>"to be" | *na*l<br>"are" | *nel*<br>"were" | *nufal*<br>"will be" | *neil*<br>"be!" | *nail*<br>"may they be" |
| ***sir-***<br>"to shine" | *siral*<br>"shine" | *sirel*<br>"shone" | *sirufal*<br>"will shine" | *sireil*<br>"shine!" | *sirail*<br>"may they shine" |

By this point, it can be guessed that the Quenya "v" has changed into a softer "f" sound, in the change from the Quenya "-uva" future suffix to the Angarul "-ufa." Likewise can be surmised the shifting of "l" from "r", at least in some cases (and vice versa in some others), by the plural verb suffix.
## Pronoun Incorporation

In Quenya, pronouns are often indicated by another suffix, and Angarul is no different. Angarul uses "(r)m" for I (Q. "n"), "lmet" for We (Q. (l)met), and "(l)re" for You (Q. "lye"). Continuing on our path, this allows us to add four new forms for each tense.

Quenya allows for the "l" in the "we" suffix to supplant it's plural "r", however since the Angarul plural suffix is an "l", this is already true. The "r" in "rm" is only an aesthetic use, often used to produce more rounded sounds in words. The "l" in "lre" is used to indicate second-person plural (you-all).
### Pronoun Incorporation on Verbs

| ***sir-***<br>"to shine" | *siram*<br>"I shine" | *siralmet*<br>"we shine" | *sirare*<br>"you shine" | *siralre*<br>"you-all shine" |

| ***sir-***<br>"to shine" | *sirufam*<br>"I will shine" | *sirufalmet*<br>"we will shine" | *sirufare*<br>"you will shine" | *sirufalre*<br>"you-all will shine" |

| Imperative<br>Voice | 1.SG<br>Present | 1.PL<br>Present | 2.SG<br>Present | 2.PL<br>Present |
| ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| ***n-***<br>"to be" | *neirm*<br>"I am!" | *neilmet*<br>"We are!" | *neire*<br>"You are!" | *neilre*<br>"You-all are!" |
| ***sir-***<br>"to shine" | *sireim*<br>"I shine!" | *sireilmet*<br>"We shine!" | *sireire*<br>"You shine!" | *sireilre*<br>"You-all shine!" |

| Subjunctive<br>Voice | 1.SG<br>Present | 1.PL<br>Present | 2.SG<br>Present | 2.PL<br>Present |
| ---- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| ***n-***<br>"to be" | *naim*<br>"may I be" | *nailmet*<br>"may we be" | *naire*<br>"may you be" | *nailre*<br>"may you-all be" |
| ***sir-***<br>"to shine" | *siraim*<br>"may I<br>shine" | *sirailmet*<br>"may we<br>shine" | *siraire*<br>"may you<br>shine" | *sirailre*<br>"may you-all<br>shine" |
Thus any verb can be conjugated from its root form into the major forms, as well as indicating person (at least first and second person).

# Changing Quenya to Angarul Kenyu
Here now are the basic conventions for converting from Quenya to Kenyu.
### **The Babel Text**
One common test in these days of language making is that a Babel Text can be made in the language, and so I will prove that it can be done in both Quenya and Angarul.

#### _Quenya_

```ngloss
\ex Rélesse norelye erquenya ar erlambe. 
\gl Days-in
	were-people
	one-speech
	and
	one-tongue
\ft In those days, the people were of one speech and one tongue.
```

```ngloss
\ex Ar tuleyes cir ve nore tulerôm,
\gl And
	came-it
	to.pass
	as
	people
	came-east
\ft And it came to pass as the people moved eastward,
```
### Paternoster

Another test used is that of the Paternoster or "Our Father", the Lord's Prayer.

```ngloss
\ft Our father who art in heaven
```
