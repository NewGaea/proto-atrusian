Semeric script is based on a 20 glyph alphabet, with its sounds equivalent to the basic sounds of English -- none of the redundant sounds or bigram letters are present. In addition, there is only one Case -- there are no "lower-case" and "upper-case" glyphs for the letters, only a single set of 20 letters, two modifiers, and a few pieces of punctuation.

The sounds are generally similar to English, however they do vary a bit. Below is a chart detailing each character, its Romanized form, and its pronunciation relative to English. Note that it is organized in English Alphabetical order.

Now comes the fun part... You get to learn the ordering of the Runes in the Semeric system. When formally written, the Semeric Alphabet is written Ten Runes to a line, thus taking two lines.

> L S D E J M K N I Z
> R A H B P G T O V U

There are also a few digraphs, letter pairs that join to make a single sound, not necessarily equal to the pairing of their own sounds. These digraphs, however, are fairly easy to remember, and are actually the result of old runes.

| Digraph | Romanized Sound | Sound Example    |
| :------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| sh      | sh              | **sh**ot         |
| dh      | dh              | **th**en         |
| kh      | ch              | **ch**ess        |
| th      | th              | **th**in         |
| rh      | rr              | Esp. *pe**rr**o* |

With these Digrams, you may wonder about Diphthongs, or Vowel Pairs. Vowels in Semeric Script are _always_ pronounced individually and separately, in sequence. "AU" is always as in "_S**au**ron_" (Sindarin), to provide an example.

Their numbers have names, as well, and are written as a simple set of Long and short vertical lines. There are two names used for each basic number, one for the number as a single value, and the other as part of a larger value.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

0. sär
1. un, lan
2. do, dzu
3. ib, gin
4. ïn, law
5. fîa, ke
6. ku, vrin
7. gan, nol
8. ki, har
9. len, ün
10. dek

The first name is used for combining as part of a number, the lower name refers to the number on its own. for example 44 is *ïndekïn* /a͜in.dɛk.a͜in/, and 81 is *kidekun* /kɪ.dɛk.uˑn/. Counting to twenty would go somehting like this: *Lan, dzu, gin, ke, vrin, nol, har, un, dek, dekun, degdo, dekib, dekïn, dexfîa, dekku, deggan, dekki, delen, dodek.*

Semeriku indicates four genders in speech -- masculine, feminine, animate, and inanimate. For the first two, certain terms in a sentence must have an agreeing gender. In pronouns, they have "I" in masculine and feminine forms, as well as a shared form for objects. They have "you" in all four genders, as well as the pronouns, "he", "she", and two forms of "it" and it's related terms.

#### _Semeriku Gender/Pronoun Chart_

|                     | Masculine | Feminine | Animate   | Inanimate |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1SG<br>"I, me"      | orä       | ashe     | umo[^2]   | umo[^2]   |
| 1PL<br>"we, us"     | orata     | asheta   | umota[^2] | umota[^2] |
| 2SG<br>"you"        | kimä      | jule     | lumo      | damo      |
| 2PL<br>"you all"    | kimata    | juleta   | lumota    | damota    |
| 3M.SG<br>"he, him"  | kurä      | kure[^3] | kumä      | kumä      |
| 3F.SG<br>"she, her" | kaulä[^3] | kaule    | kaume     | kaume     |
| 3N.SG<br>"it, its"  | ---       | ---      | duvre     | takhe     |

This system may seem similar to Japanese, to those familiar with it. Well, this is because it is. For example, the masculine form of "I" is used by male speakers, while the feminine is used by females. The "Third Person Neutral" form is used primarily when writing from the view of someone (or something) with no gender or unknown gender. Likewise the use of the forms of "we." The speaker's gender also sometimes determines which form of "he" or "she" to use, although in casual speech it's a simple matter of using the appropriate term (feminine she, masculine he) instead.

The easy way to be sure of what to use is that in first person, Men are "orä" and Women are "ashe". In second person, Men are "kimä" and Women are "jule". In third person, Men are usually "kurä", Women are usually "kaule". For a non-gender specific term, use the "Animate" term.

Also, carried from it certain people-counting terms can be made. "Lankän", for example, is "one person", "dzukän" is "two people", and so forth. "Dedekän" refers to many people, literally "a hundred people", but it is normally a figurative use. In fact, this system is rarely used for groups of more than five or six people, leaving "dedek" (100) free to refer to a multitude.

The most interesting, though, is the use of "-ta", as in "dzukän-ta", meaning "you two people." Though not often used in modern speech, as the construction of "lumo dzu" is the preferred way of expressing it, many of the ancient tablets contain "Dzukän-ta", or similar terms indicating number.

## *Semeriku dojë* | Semeric Particles

One is done no great service to learn the word of Semericu without learning the particles which define the purpose of those words in a sentence.

The most basic particles are 'hûä', 'gan', 'vo', and 'kä".

Hûä [ hwä ] indicates that the word or phrase which it follows is the subject of discussion. This is most properly used when beginning a paragraph or discourse or lecture, to establish what is being discussed. This allows a very simple statement and requires nothing further after the particle, though the sentence can still be elaborated upon.

Example: kin'gï'gyö hûä
Meaning: On the topic of machinists...

[^1]: This form is only used by Gramurn, the Semerikän see no actual use for this form of the symbol, aside from Loan Words. Also: KH
[^2]: These forms are technically available, but are only used when anthropomorphizing animals or non-living objects.
[^3]: These forms are hypothetical, but would not be widely used as the gender of third person pronouns must agree with their referent.
