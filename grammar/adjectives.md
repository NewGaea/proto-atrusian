# Proto-Atrusian Adejctives

Adjectives rarely occur as independent words in Proto-Atrusian, instead being prefixed to nouns (such as _alta_ + _súre_ = _altasúre_ 'big wind')

## Order of Adjectives

The order of adjectives is typically as follows:

+ Opinion (good, bad)
+ Age (old, young, ancient, new)
+ Size (big, small, heavy, light)
+ Shape (flat, round, sharp, smooth)
+ Colour (light, dark, fair, grim)
+ Origin (Semeric, Elressie, Adin)
+ Material (iron, wood, leather, brick)
+ Quantity (many, few, one, five)
+ Purpose (evil, noble, cutting, valued)

However, if it is necessary to modify an adjective, an adjective may be placed in an atypical position _directly after_ the other adjective it modifies, or may use a special placeholder construction using the pronoun _ma_ for positive descriptions, or _il_ for negative descriptions.

When combining adjectives, duplicate vowels or consonants are merged together. For example, the phrase "big new red wheel" would be constructed as "_new big red wheel_" and would be composed of _sinya_ + _alta_ + _karne_ + _norne_, or _sinyaltakarnenornen_.

## Nominalizing Adjectives

In the event that you need to turn an adjective into a noun or pronoun, you may make an adjectival conjunct using _er-_ as a prefix and _-ine_ as a suffix (replacing the terminal vowel for words which end in vowels). Thus, to say "red" as a noun, it is transformed from _karne_ to _erkarnine_
