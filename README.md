# proto-atrusian

Documentation and samples of Proto-Atrusian, the root language of Atrusian Elves, Dwarves, Orks, and Halflings

This language is heavily based on the initial word forms of J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish languages, [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) and [Sindarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin), though it is my objective to use the basic forms of the words to create a language with a different grammatical structure. This language is primarily designed only as a reference language for the development of other Atrusian languages, and as a sandbox for the author to explore using scripted tools.
